## 💡 The Problem It Solves

When you live with others, someone always pays the groceries, another one covers the electricity bill, and a third buys cleaning supplies. Keeping track of who owes what becomes a headache. CoLoc Manager handles all of that automatically.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Roommates join a shared group and start logging expenses together
- The app tracks who paid what and calculates everyone's fair share automatically
- A clear "who owes whom" view shows the minimum payments needed to settle all debts — no spreadsheets, no arguments
- When a payment is made, it gets recorded and the balances update instantly
- Members who consistently pay their debts build a good reputation score, adding a layer of trust and accountability to the group

---

## 👥 Who Uses It

**Roommates** log expenses, check their balance, and mark payments as done.

**The flat organizer (Owner)** manages the group — inviting people, organizing expense categories, and keeping things running.

**A platform administrator** oversees the whole service, with the ability to view statistics and moderate users if needed.

## ✅ Key Highlights

- Invitation system via secure email links — no one joins without being invited
- Only one active group per user — keeping things clean and unambiguous
- Reputation system that rewards financially responsible behavior
