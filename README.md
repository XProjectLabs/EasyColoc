## 💡 The Problem It Solves

When you live with others, someone always pays the groceries, another one covers the electricity bill, and a third buys cleaning supplies. Keeping track of who owes what becomes a headache. CoLoc Manager handles all of that automatically.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Roommates join a shared group and start logging expenses together
- The app tracks who paid what and calculates everyone's fair share automatically
- A clear "who owes whom" view shows the minimum payments needed to settle all debts — no spreadsheets, no arguments
- When a payment is made, it gets recorded and the balances update instantly
- Members who consistently pay their debts build a good reputation score, adding a layer of trust and accountability to the group
