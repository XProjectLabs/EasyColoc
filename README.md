## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

![Alt text](https://maghreb.simplonline.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimplonline-v3-prod.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com%2Fmedia%2Fimage%2Fpng%2Feasycoloc-banner-699b976828dd9364128669.png&w=1280&q=75)

**EasyColoc Manager** is a web application designed to simplify life in shared apartments. Managing money between roommates is often a source of tension this app removes that friction entirely.

---

## 💡 The Problem It Solves

When you live with others, someone always pays the groceries, another one covers the electricity bill, and a third buys cleaning supplies. Keeping track of who owes what becomes a headache. CoLoc Manager handles all of that automatically.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Roommates join a shared group and start logging expenses together
- The app tracks who paid what and calculates everyone's fair share automatically
- A clear "who owes whom" view shows the minimum payments needed to settle all debts — no spreadsheets, no arguments
- When a payment is made, it gets recorded and the balances update instantly
- Members who consistently pay their debts build a good reputation score, adding a layer of trust and accountability to the group

---

## 👥 Who Uses It

**Roommates** log expenses, check their balance, and mark payments as done.

**The flat organizer (Owner)** manages the group — inviting people, organizing expense categories, and keeping things running.

**A platform administrator** oversees the whole service, with the ability to view statistics and moderate users if needed.

---

## ✅ Key Highlights

- Invitation system via secure email links — no one joins without being invited
- Only one active group per user — keeping things clean and unambiguous
- Reputation system that rewards financially responsible behavior
- Simple, transparent and fair for everyone in the flat

---

*Built as a full-stack academic project — designed, architected, and developed solo at  Youcode School.*
